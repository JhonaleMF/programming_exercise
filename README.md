# Programming_exercise - Largest sum of a contiguous subarray

Python scripts which include the functions to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum and testing units.
The complexity of both functions are:
- contiguous_subarray : Quadratic O(n^2)
- contiguous_subarray_LC : Linear O(n)

Libraries used: Numpy and unittest for testing the two functions.
